### Introduction

In recent years, there has been a surge in the demand for fast and responsive web applications. Static websites have been gaining popularity due to their speed, security, and scalability. In this blog post, we will discuss how to build static websites using Next.js, MDX, Tailwind, and Vercel.

### Next.js

Next.js is a popular React framework that allows developers to build server-side rendered React applications. Next.js eliminates the need for setting up a complex build system, enabling developers to focus on building their applications. With Next.js, developers can easily create static websites, server-side rendered applications, and even progressive web applications.

### MDX

MDX is a markup language that combines Markdown syntax with React components. This allows developers to write markdown files that can include interactive React components. MDX is perfect for creating documentation sites, blogs, and other content-driven websites. With MDX, developers can easily create interactive and engaging content without the need for complex build systems.

### Tailwind

Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to create responsive designs with minimal effort. Tailwind provides a set of pre-defined CSS classes that developers can use to style their applications. Developers can easily customize their designs by editing their Tailwind configuration file. Tailwind is perfect for building static websites as it eliminates the need for writing custom CSS, enabling developers to focus on building their applications.

### Vercel

Vercel is a cloud-based platform that provides developers with a simple and intuitive way to deploy their applications. Vercel supports a variety of frameworks and languages, including Next.js, React, Vue, and Angular. With Vercel, developers can easily deploy their applications to a global CDN, ensuring that their applications are fast and responsive to users worldwide.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, building static websites with Next.js, MDX, Tailwind, and Vercel provides developers with a simple and efficient way to build fast and responsive web applications. With these tools, developers can easily create interactive and engaging content without the need for complex build systems. Moreover, deploying applications with Vercel ensures that they are fast and responsive, providing users with an optimal experience. Therefore, we recommend using these tools when building static websites.

## How to Build a Static Website with Next.js, MDX, Tailwind, and Vercel

Now that we have discussed the benefits of using Next.js, MDX, Tailwind, and Vercel, let's dive into how to build a static website using these tools.

### Step 1: Setting up a Next.js Project

To get started, we need to create a new Next.js project. We can do this using the following command:

```
npx create-next-app my-static-website

```

This command will create a new Next.js project in a folder called `my-static-website`.

### Step 2: Adding MDX Support

Next, we need to add MDX support to our project. To do this, we need to install the `@next/mdx` package:

```
npm install @next/mdx

```

After installing the package, we need to add the following code to our `next.config.js` file:

```
const withMDX = require('@next/mdx')()

module.exports = withMDX({
  // Your Next.js config
})

```

This code will enable MDX support in our project.

### Step 3: Adding Tailwind CSS

Next, we need to add Tailwind CSS to our project. We can do this by installing the `tailwindcss` and `@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat` packages:

```
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss7-compat

```

After installing the packages, we need to create a new file called `tailwind.config.js` in our project's root directory and add the following code:

```
module.exports = {
  purge: ['./pages/**/*.js', './components/**/*.js'],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

```

This code will configure Tailwind CSS for our project.

Next, we need to create a new file called `styles/globals.css` and add the following code:

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

```

This code will import Tailwind CSS into our project.

### Step 4: Building and Deploying with Vercel

Finally, we need to build and deploy our project with Vercel. To do this, we can use the following command:

```
vercel

```

This command will build and deploy our project to a global CDN, ensuring that our website is fast and responsive to users worldwide.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, building static websites with Next.js, MDX, Tailwind, and Vercel provides developers with a simple and efficient way to build fast and responsive web applications. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, developers can easily create interactive and engaging content without the need for complex build systems. Moreover, deploying applications with Vercel ensures that they are fast and responsive, providing users with an optimal experience. Therefore, we highly recommend using these tools when building static websites.
